# CodingQuiz


Online exam system. The exam system will deal with only one type of question - open ended programming questions of the
form: "Write a method named calcSomthing that takes parameters named a and b of type int, calculates (whatever), and returns the appropriate value." You may choose either Java or Python as your language and assume questions will be of the level appropriate for a course similar to CS 100 or CS 113.

Release Candidate: All of the above but completely polished and without bugs.

Release Version: No new fuctionality. Design or architecture should be refactored. Must report on changes and turn in UML diagrams, i.e., use-case, sequence, and UML diagram of your choice.

Constraints:

Follow a Model View Controller architecture structured as a three-tiered client-server system. Each contributor will be responsible for 
only one part, with no overlap. Each contributor may run their code ONLY from your own AFS account and communicate with the other tiers using standard web protocols.

Contributors must develop a communication protocol for all communication between tiers. Post requests will be used for requests; 
XML or JSON will be used for replies.
